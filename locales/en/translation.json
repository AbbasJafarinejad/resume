    "about": "I started my journey in IT in 2012 by enrolling in university and participating in educational courses such as PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. From 2014 to 2021, I taught web design and programming in schools and training centers. During this time, I also worked on freelance projects in backend development, SEO, WordPress, and web design for domestic and North American companies. Additionally, I gained experience as an IT manager and later as a digital marketing manager for two different companies. Since last year, I have focused on frontend development, enhancing my skills through various resources. During this period, I gained valuable experience by participating in two projects as an intern and junior developer, and I am eager to continue learning and growing through new opportunities."
